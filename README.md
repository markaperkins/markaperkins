### About Me
I am starting my doctoral journey and will be researching cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. I intend to focus on intrusion detection and prevention using artificial intelligence and am currently reviewing literature in the field. This repository will mainly hold projects or snippets of code that I found helpful on my doctoral journey, even if they aren't directly related to my research. Use any code I publish at your own risk, but feel free to use, modify, or tweak anything I make public.

### Currently Working On
1. Developing a MongoDB-backed logging system for the various services and integrations I will use.
2. Developing a library for securing data in memory and at rest for middleware services I am developing for my research.
